//			If you got this message, please respond
//
//				I recieved your message
//					Oh! Thank goodness! This thing really works!!!
//						What thing?
//							This old communication device that I'm using. I found it in the basement.
//								Which Basement?
//									The basement of the main bunker.
//								Why are you using such an old device?
//									I've been trapped underground for who knows how long, and I this was the only device I could find. It's so old, I'm surprised it still works...
//						Why were you trying to contact me?
//							I'm trapped.
//								Where are you trapped?
//									I trapped myself in the underground of the main Bunker.
//									How long have you been trapped?
//										I lost track. I estimate a few days.
//										Do you need my help?
//											Yes. I was hoping if you could help me find a way out, or at least contact someone who can.
//				Who are you? 
//					    My name is Cynthia Connors.  I work as a caretaker in the main bunker.
//						What bunker?
//							The Main Bunker in Sector 21? Haven't you heard of it?
//								Where is Sector 21?
//								No, I haven't heard of it.
//						What are you supposed to care for?
//							Well, to tell you the truth, I don't have a good idea. It's top secret. All I know is I tried to find out and I got stuck.
//								Got stuck?
//								Is that why you contacted me?
